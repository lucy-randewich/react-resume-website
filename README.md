# Simple resume website
This repository hosts my personal resume website, which gives a brief overview of who I am and what I do. I designed and implemented the site in Summer 2023 and have been updating and maintaining it since. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This repository is hosted on github pages, which redirects to my personal domain http://lucyrandewich.co.uk.
